# How to Play
1. Install the [TIC-80](http://tic.computer) virtual console on your computer.
1. Launch TIC-80 and type the ``surf`` command.
1. Select ``[tic.computer/play]`` and press Z to select it.
1. Find ``FPS80`` on the list and press Z to start it.

Alternative: you can also play the game [on the TIC-80 website](https://tic.computer/play?cart=237), but the web player is not as fast, and there are issues with the sound, so if at all possible, use the install option above.
